# serumstuff2
This repository consists of a few files which I bundled together for Î±DMD installations. 

Configured only for TRON 128x32 LED DMD users.

## How to install?

```
cd
cd ~/code_dmdreader
git clone https://github.com/p69172002/serumstuff2
```
## Configuring the files
After having cloned the repository, you must change the paths in `exec.sh` and `tron.json`

## Running the script
```
cd
cd ~/code_dmdreader/serumstuff2
sudo ./exec.sh
```
